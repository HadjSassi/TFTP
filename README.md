### 2. Call getaddrinfo to obtain the serverâ€™s address.
To follow the clean code we've split our code into multiple functions
and we have shown the IPv4 address in both gettftp and puttftp.
Since we're using the localhost as our host then the IPv4 address is ```127.0.0.1```

### 1. Use command-line arguments for the gettftp and puttftp programs to obtain request information (server and file).

We tested the both codes, with the command line, by passing the arguments and then
we'll work on the edit configuration to make it easier!

Using Command line!
