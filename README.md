# TFTP TP2 By ELLOUMI Molka and HADJ SASSI Mahdi

### 4. For gettftp:
Difficulties: Wireshark is not functional in our case, maybe because
we're using WSL as our environment and we're running the wireshark on
windows, so it can't detect the same channel.

Then to surpass this limit we've run on a WSL terminal this command to see
the different requests passed !
``tcpdump -i lo -v --print``

After running our TFTP Server, and we passed as arguments: localhost and
ones1024 we got this response :
```

#### b) Receive a file consisting of a single Data (DAT) packet and its acknowledgment (ACK).
since we're requesting ones1024 so we got this response :

#### c) Receive a file consisting of multiple Data (DAT) packets and their respective acknowledgments (ACK).
Since we're requesting ones1024 so we got this response :

### 3. Reserve a connection socket to the server.
We've defined a socket initialization in the utils.c and we've called in the ``puttftp.c`` and ``getftp.c``


### 2. Call getaddrinfo to obtain the serverâ€™s address.
To follow the clean code we've split our code into multiple functions
and we have shown the IPv4 address in both gettftp and puttftp.
Since we're using the localhost as our host then the IPv4 address is ```127.0.0.1```

### 1. Use command-line arguments for the gettftp and puttftp programs to obtain request information (server and file).

We tested the both codes, with the command line, by passing the arguments and then
we'll work on the edit configuration to make it easier!

Using Command line!

Now using the edit configuration!
